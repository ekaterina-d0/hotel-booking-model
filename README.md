# Hotel Booking Cancellation Predictor

This project uses logistic regression to predict hotel booking cancellations based on a dataset of over 119,000 reservations. The goal is to help hotel managers optimize their booking strategies and reduce the impact of cancellations.

## üìä Features
- **Data Cleaning & EDA**: Initial data exploration and preparation, including handling missing values and feature transformations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applied logistic regression to predict cancellations with high accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn
- **Environments**: PyCharm

## üöÄ Results
Key predictors of cancellations were identified, such as lead time, number of previous cancellations, and customer type. This analysis provides actionable insights for hotel managers to:
- Optimize booking strategies.
- Allocate resources more efficiently.
- Improve guest satisfaction by reducing booking friction.

## üåü How This Analysis Helps Make Decisions
This analysis directly informs decision-making by helping hotel managers predict cancellations and take proactive steps to minimize the impact.
